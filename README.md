# Prefix-Preserving IP Address Anonymization


Original CryptoPAn Can only be used to encrypt the dataset(IPaddresses)by ensuring prefix preservation for every 8bits,16bits,24bits or 32bits in IPv4. Extend it to ensure prefix preservation for any length of prefixes. Discuss the extension in the report.

Perform two groups of attacks: CPA and CCA,respectively. For each of them,querying n pair(s) of plaintext-ciphertext, n = 1,...,100,the adversary will reconstruct the most bits out of the 10k IPaddresses(including brute-force,if you prefer).Implement such two attacks(illustrate the algorithms for your proposed attacks in the report), as well as report 100 groups of results for each of them and their percents of reconstructed bits (out of all the IPaddresses).
